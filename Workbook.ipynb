This includes everything from initial data acquisition to organization, integration, access, and preservation. Data typically originate from a variety of sources, in a variety of formats, and may need transformation. Curation often involves the selection of a basic model for storage and organization that requires an understanding of the data as well as any objectives for its use.\n",

As a starting point, the team has decided to work with the publicly-available [Food Inspections](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5) data from the City of Chicago. \n",
